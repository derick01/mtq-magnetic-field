# Magnetic field of magnetic torquers

This program calculates the magnetic field of a magnetic torquer
composed of current segments. The points where the field will be
calculated are defined in the `A` tensor. This contains the coordinates
of the points in three dimensions. Alternatively, `A` can be made to
contain points along planes parallel to the XY, YZ, or ZX planes by
setting the appropriate argument in the `mesgrid` function.
